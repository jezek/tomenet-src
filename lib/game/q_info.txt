# New (2018): Most text lines (W:, yR:, X:, x:, Wr:) can call a lua function. It must begin with two slashes and nothing else must be in the line.
# Parameters are possible. As usual, ':' symbols are not allowed anywhere. Lua functions cannot change any quest parameters except for flags.
# If a lua function is supposed to be able to read and/or write flags, it must have a parameter named <?flags?>. If it needs to actually modify the flags,
# it must have a parameter named <!flags!> and the function must return a string containing two comma-separated 16-bit values, set-flag-mask and clear-flag-mask again.
# The !flags! or ?flags? parameter must always be the FIRST parameter specified. Eg:
# yR:-://qtestlua1("Hello.", 3)
# Wr:0:0://qtestlua2(!flags!, "$$Q That's not the right password, $$r!")  and this function would:
#   return set_mask .. "," .. clear_mask    --- or as a specific min/max example:    return 0 .. "," .. 65535
# Note that the actual lua function will always need to have an 'Ind' parameter before all other custom parameters from the call definition in q_info.txt.
# If the function queries or even modifies flags, the '?flags?' or '!flags!' will translate to  just <flags> as the FIRST parameter in the function call.
# All further parameters, if any, come after that. Eg (in regards to above examples):
#   function qtestlua1(Ind, message, number)
#     ....
#   end
#   function qtestlua2(flags, Ind, message)
#     ....
#     return set_mask..","..clear_mask
#   end

# Further notes:
# -The index number must just be counting up for each quest added to this file, starting with 0.
# -The internal codename must be unique among all quests and exactly 10 characters long.
# -All quests should currently be set to 'individual'! (Global quests work depending on the quest goals. Some won't, though.)
#  Individual means either '1' (goals are shared with party members) or '2' (must be completely soloed). '0' means 'global' and is currently not implemented.
# -Stage changes can use negative numbers. In that case the new stage is the current stage + random 1..(absolute value of nextstage). Eg -3 -> will proceed +1, +2 or +3 stages randomly.
# -questor types 1 (monster) and 3 (object) are supported at the moment.
# -questor 'locations' are: +1 for 'world surface', +2 for 'town' (so '3' for both). Must not be zero unless a specific wpos is set instead.
# -For item questors you might want to set 'examine' flag so they don't "talk" to you.
# -#goal is 1..5 for main goal, and -1..-5 for optional goals.
# -Although the 'examine' flag can be specified for each conversation line again, the last line existing for a questor/stage combination will take priority.
# -About dialogues/narrations:
#   Use [[...]] to highlight the text between the brackets.
#   You can automatically insert the player's name, title, race, race-attribute ('elven') or class, by using these placeholders: $$N, $$T, $$R, $AA, $$C.
#   If you don't want the first letter to be capitalised, use $$n, $$t, $$r, $$a, $$c instead.
#   $$P will substitute the amount of party members (0 for no party).
# -About keywords:
#   "~" means the empty keyword "", user can just press ENTER key without writing anything to trigger it.
#   if the FIRST MATCHING (questor+stage) keyword is "y" it brings up a yes/no prompt. The second questor/stage-matching keyword should be "n".
#   (*) Keywords set to 'any stage' (-1) are not sufficient to stop an otherwise empty stage from terminate nor to prompt a quest_dialogue() on their own.
# -About global 'flags':
#   '-' means no flags.
#   For lines that change those: 'a' to 'p' to clear flags, 'A' to 'P' to set flags, eg  ..:aBChK:..
#   For lines that check those (conversational lines): 'A' to 'P' to check for a flag, which must be set (to display the convo line etc). Cleared flags don't matter.
# -About retrieving items:
#   char/attr '-' means 'any', pval/bpval -9999 means 'any', oname1/2/2b -1 means 'any' and -2 means 'any but must not be zero'.
# -About R/O lines:
#   If R-lines are given for a stage, but no O line is defined, the rewards are handed out "for free" in that stage.

# You must never use the ':' char in any keyword or text line, since it's used as delimiter here.
# #questor is 0..29 (30 questors max)
# #stage is 1..29 (30 stages max, 0 is reserved for the initial stage)
# talk/narration can have up to 15 text lines
# keywords can be up to 29 characters long
# #goal is 1..5 for main goal, and -1..-5 for optional goals.
#  Optional goals are currently NOT IMPLEMENTED and will break the quest!
# Status effects (rewards): Positive numbers indicate a potion, scroll, staff or non-directional(!) rod from k_info.txt.
#  Negative numbers are extra effects: -1 = 1000t of luck, -2 = 2000t of luck, -3 = 3000t of luck.
