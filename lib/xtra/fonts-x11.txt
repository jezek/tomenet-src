# This file allows you to add arbitrary system bitmap fonts to the list of
# fonts the TomeNET client shows in the fonts menu (press =f to invoke).
# It is auto-loaded by X11 (Linux/OSX) clients on entering the font menu.
# This file has no effect on the Windows client, use the 'fonts' folder there.

# Example (think the '#' character in the beginning of the line removed):
#-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso8859-1
